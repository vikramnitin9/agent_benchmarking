Refactor the code in main.py by separating each class into a different file.
Feel free to create new directories or move around files as you like.
Make sure that the code still runs, at the end of this. First rebuild the Docker container to include the new code. Note that you need to do this every time your Python code changes:
```
docker build . -t translation_gym:latest
```
Then once this completes successfully, the command to run the code is:
```
bash run.sh toy gpt4o
```
The entire program might take a while to run, but you should see this output and an exit code of 0:
