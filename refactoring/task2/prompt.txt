Refactor the code in `refactoring/task2/<dirname>/main.py` by separating each class into a different file.
Feel free to create new directories or move around files as you like.
Make sure that the code still runs, at the end of this. First rebuild the Docker container to include the new code. Note that you need to do this every time your Python code changes:
```
docker build . -t translation_gym:latest
```
Then once this completes successfully, the command to run the code is:
```
bash run.sh toy gpt4o
```
The entire program might take a very long time to run, but if you see a line saying "Translation succeeded" then you can assume that the program is correct.
