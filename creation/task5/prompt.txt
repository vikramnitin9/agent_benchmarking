Suppose I have some data in the following format where every row corresponds to a function:
```
FuncName, Length, Result
foo, 20, Success
bar, 120, Failure
...
```
I want to plot a graph of the success rate against length, where the length is divided into bins of size 10.
E.g., 0-10, 10-20, ...
I want to plot a line graph of the success rate of each bin. On the same graph, I want to plot a bar plot of the number of functions in each bin.

A screenshot of the desired graph is in `prompt.png`. Try to replicate it a closely as possible, including legend, axis labels, etc.

Write a Python script with Matplotlib to do this. Create some sample data as well as the Python program. Run the Python program and save the plot to `plot.pdf`.
Create all your files in the current directory.
