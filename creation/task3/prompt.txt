Create a Docker container that wraps a Python program.
When the container is run, I want to run the Python program within the container, get its output, and write it to a file `log.txt` that is accessible from outside the container.
Create a placeholder "Hello World" Python program. Also create the Dockerfile and all other necessary files. Build and run the container to verify that the log.txt file contains "Hello World".
Create all your files in the current directory.
