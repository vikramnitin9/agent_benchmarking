In the directory `debugging/task3/<dirname>`, I'm building a utility, `parsec` to parse C code, add instrumentation to it, and generate a static library. I build it with the following commands:
```
cd debugging/task3/<dirname>/
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. && make
```
Then I run it on the example code to generate the static library and the executable:
```
cd ../example
make clean && bear make
../build/parsec *c
clang libfoo.a -o foo
```
This works fine, but when I run the executable, there is a segmentation fault.
```
./foo hello.txt
```
If I do this process without running `parsec`, the `foo` executable runs fine. So there must be some issue with `parsec`, possibly in the instrumentation, that is causing the segmentation fault.

Could you debug and fix the error? Feel free to run the code and observe the segmentation fault. `parsec` adds debug information, so you could also run gdb if necessary.
